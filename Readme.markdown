# ReaderLater

As of [Safari 6](https://developer.apple.com/technologies/safari/whats-new.html) there’s a big “Reader” button staring you in the face at all times. ReaderLater replaces it with a “Later” button that’s wired straight to [Instapaper](http://instapaper.com).

## Requirement

* Safari 6.0
* [SIMBL](http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php) 0.9.9 (might work with earlier versions)

## Installation

1. Install [SIMBL](http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php)
2. [Download the newest version](https://github.com/bencochran/ReaderLater/downloads) and place it in `~/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/`
3. Restart Safari
